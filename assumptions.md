My aim was to deliver MVP so only focusing on functions that were required.

Assumptions:

* There can only be one explorer and one maze, so collision detection was not in the scope.
* There were no restriction on the maze apart from 1 start and 1 exit point, so it does not check that maze can be completed or not.
